| CASTLEMANIA v0.1 Oct 31st 2019 |
|================================|

 This is an unlicensed Freeware Castlevania fangame where you can play as a vampire
 hunter (Eric Lecarde) or Dracula himself. This project is not affiliated in any way
 with KONAMI, the current owners of Castlevania franchise.
 
 This prototype was developed in around two months for a college assignment for a 
 fake game project pitch. We originally wanted to add a lot more features and fix
 most of the issues, but we didn't really have a lot of free time past its original 
 presentation and we wanted to have this out in time for Halloween. Regardless, we 
 believe it's still pretty fun as a proof of concept.

 If there's enough interest, we might consider extending this game in the future.

 Have fun!

| HOW TO PLAY |
|=============|

 This is a competitive two-player game only. Currently, only the host can play as 
 the vampire hunter, while the player who joins the match can only play as Dracula.
 
 The goal for either player is to defeat their opponent. The vampire hunter gets 5
 lives, while Dracula only gets 1. There's also a timer that shows the total match 
 time, which can be your tie-breaker if you swap roles between rounds.

  Games are automatically detected over a local network as long as the network device 
  supports broadcast packets.

 ************
 * Internet *
 ************

  The game will attempt to open port 45387 (TCP/UDP) by using UPNP, which is available 
  on most modern home routers. If it succeeds, your public IP will be shown to you 
  so you can send it to the person you wish to play with (your IP is hidden by default, 
  so don't worry if you're streaming). If this fails, you can attempt to open the required 
  port manually by configuring your router.

  You can also play using VPN solutions like Hamachi by hosting on the local network 
  and searching for the match or joining via the Internet option which allows you to 
  type in the IP manually.
